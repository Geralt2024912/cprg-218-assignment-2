            <p>My career began either by chance or by fate, at New Oriental School,the biggest English training school
                in China,where I spent the first 2 years working there before and after college,
                learning and touching the most remarkable Chinese English teachers and teaching methods. This experience
                led me plant the most developed concept of teaching in my mind, marking a significant
                transition from student to teacher.</p>

            <p>Owing to my fate's arrangement, I went back to my hometown to teach at Hanzhong Longgang School.
                I began my teaching career with enthusiasm and dedication. Over two years, I
                developed fundamental teaching skills, created engaging English lessons, and built strong connections
                with students and colleagues. This experience laid the foundation for my teaching career in China.</p>

            <p>My eight years at Ankang Gaoxin Middle School were transformative. I refined my teaching methodology,
                took on additional responsibilities, and deeply immersed myself in the Chinese education system. This
                long-term experience helped me understand the nuances of difficult points of teaching English in China
                and the importance of adaptable teaching methods.</p>
